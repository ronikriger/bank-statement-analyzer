## Features

- **PDF Text Extraction**: Automatically extracts text from multi-page PDF bank statements.
- **ChatGPT Analysis**: Uses OpenAI's ChatGPT API to generate narrative insights from extracted text.
- **ML Transaction Analysis**:  
  - Parses raw text into structured transaction data.  
  - Categorizes transactions (e.g., Deposits, Expenses).  
  - Detects anomalies using machine learning (Isolation Forest).  
  - Provides detailed visualizations.
- **Time Series Forecasting**: Aggregates historical transactions to forecast future cash flows with an Exponential Smoothing model.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: A Streamlit-based interface for exploring transactions, filtering data, and viewing dynamic charts and forecasting outputs.
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Delivers clear, actionable insights derived from bank statement data.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7 or higher** is required.
- It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment.

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ronikriger/bank-statement-analyzer.git
   cd bank-statement-analyzer
   
2. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate

3. **Install Dependencies**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
Make sure that requirements.txt includes all necessary packages (see Dependencies for a sample list).

## Usage

### Running the Pipeline

#### Prepare the Bank Statement PDFs

- Place your bank statement PDFs in the `bankstatements/` directory.
- Name them appropriately (e.g., `BankStatement1.pdf`, `BankStatement2.pdf`, etc.).

#### Run the Pipeline

```bash
python pdf_pipeline.py

What Happens:

Text Extraction:
The pipeline extracts text from each PDF, saving individual pages as .txt files in the extracted_texts/ directory.

ChatGPT Analysis:
Each extracted text file is processed by ChatGPT to generate narrative insights.

ML Transaction Analysis:
All text files are consolidated; transactions are parsed, categorized, and anomalies are detected.

Time Series Forecasting:
Historical cash flows are aggregated on a daily basis, and an Exponential Smoothing model forecasts future cash flows (e.g., for the next 30 days).
The forecasted results are printed, and a forecast plot is saved in the extracted_texts/ directory.

Launching the Dashboard
Ensure Streamlit and Plotly Are Installed
If you haven't yet installed these packages, run:

    ```bash
    pip install streamlit plotly

      ```bash
    streamlit run dashboard.py

Dashboard Features:

Filters:
Choose transaction categories, set date ranges, and filter anomalies.

Visualizations:

A scatter plot displays transaction amounts over time (with anomaly markers).
A bar chart summarizes transactions per category.
Summary:
Key metrics such as total transactions and detected anomalies are displayed.

Forecast Display:
If integrated, the dashboard may also include forecast visualizations and outputs.
